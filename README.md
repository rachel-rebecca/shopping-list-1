# shopping-list-1
Shopping list that can add and remove items, display shopping list, and clear the list.

This was a project I worked on independently before my bootcamp began as a way to practice topics I had learned on my own.

The webapp should allow the user to:
1. add items to the shooping list inside the text input box.
2. remove specified item by typing them into the text box.
3. clear the list to start over.

This was also modified from code that runs completely in the console. Both files are included, but only script2 is linked with the html file.
